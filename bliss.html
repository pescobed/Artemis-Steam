                Hi, Iâ€™m Bliss! I have a keen eye for design and a deep curiosity for digital security, making me passionate about both front-end development and cybersecurity.
                I love designing websites that look great and are easy to use while also making sure they are safe and secure. To me, the internet should be both beautiful and protected, and I enjoy finding the balance between creativity and security. 
                Through this journey, I want to improve my front-end skills, learn more about cybersecurity, and create better, safer online experiences.

                <p>I love solving puzzles because they challenge me to think creatively, find patterns, and push my problem-solving skills. Whether it's a tricky brain teaser or a complex jigsaw, I enjoy the satisfaction of piecing everything together.</p>
