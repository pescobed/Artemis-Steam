                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a junior at St. Edward's University, pursuing a dual major in Computer Science & Catholic Studies. 
                    My goal is to build a career in project management, where I can combine my technical knowledge with leadership skills.
                    Through the course of this project, I hope to enhance my technical skills while also developing stronger teamwork abilities.
                     By collaborating with others and managing different aspects of the project, I aim to build my experience in project management, 
                     learning how to coordinate tasks, communicate effectively, and adapt to challenges. This opportunity will allow me to refine my
                      problem-solving skills and gain practical insights into leading a successful project. </p>

        <p>One of my favorite activities is rowing on Lady Bird Lake. 
            It's a perfect combination of exercise and enjoying Austin's beautiful outdoors.</p>
            <p>When I‚Äôm home, usually a few times a month, I enjoy taking my dog for walks.
                 It‚Äôs a great way to unwind, spend time outdoors, and enjoy a break from my school routine.</p>
